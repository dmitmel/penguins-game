/// You are looking at the generated documentation for the code of The
/// %Penguins %Game project. If you are interested in playing the game itself,
/// you might want to check out the [README of the project on
/// Github](https://github.com/dmitmel/penguins-game#readme) instead. I mean,
/// the README is a good place to see anyway as it contains some notes on the
/// design and architecture of the project as well.
///
/// A good place to begin familiarizing yourself with the codebase from are the
/// #Game and #BotState structs and their associated functions.
